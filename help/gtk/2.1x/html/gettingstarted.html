				<h1>Welcome to Transmission! </h1>
			</div>
				<p>
					Transmission is a BitTorrent client.
					It is used for peer to peer filesharing over the internet.
					BitTorrent is a fast way of transferring files, because everyone who downloads must also upload to others.
					This means speeds are only limited by the number of people connected to a given torrent - the more people the better!

							Download your file's associated 'torrent file' (extension .torrent). These are commonly found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker">'tracker' websites</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you have the torrent file, click Open and select it, or simply drag it into Transmission - downloading should start immediately.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some sources provide the so-called 'magnet links' in order to download torrents. Transmission supports magnet links but you will probably have to
							associate them with Transmission from within your browser first. Alternatively, you can select File &gt; Open URL... to manually add a magnet link.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can pause and resume transfers at any time, so long as the files remain in your download folder.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is good etiquette to share or 'seed' the file for a while (ie leave it uploading to others) once your download is complete.
							That's how you downloaded the files in the first place!
						</p>
						<p>You can use a torrent's Properties window to adjust download/upload preferences on the fly.

							Yes, choose 'New...' under the 'File' menu and when the 'New Torrent' dialogue opens:
						</p>
						<p>
							1) Pull down 'Save To:' and select a folder where you want your new .torrent specification file to be created.  (You can move it later if you want.)
						</p>
						<p>
							2) To share (i.e. transmit) an entire folder of files choose 'Source folder:' and select a folder.  All files in that folder will be shared in the torrent.  
							Alternatively to share a single file choose 'Source file:' and select a filename.
						</p>
						<p>			
							3) Enter the URL of one or more Trackers that you have permission to use.  Their address will look something like this: (http//domain:portnumber/announce).
							(Trackers are web services that track the distribution of your files and offer services to make the sharing happen.  
							You will need at least one reference to a torrent tracker.  This can be added and adjusted later in the torrent properties window under the Trackers tab.)
						</p>
						<p>							
							4) Optionally enter a 'Comment' to be attached to the torrent. [TODO Say who gets this this comment (public or private?)]
						</p>
						<p>
							5) Optionally check the 'Private' torrent box. [TODO Say what this check mark does (or perhaps this is to make the comment public or private?]
						</p>
						<p>
							Once you are done be sure to click 'New'. 
							If you click 'Close' it will cancel the operation.
							Transmission will automatically optimize the torrent file for what you are sharing.
