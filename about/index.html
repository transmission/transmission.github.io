<p>Transmission is a cross-platform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29">BitTorrent</a> client that is:</p>

<h3>Open Source.</h3>
<p>Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with its users to make money:
<ul>
<li>Transmission doesn't bundle
<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-browser-toolbar-mystery-causes-havoc-among-users-101218/">toolbars</a>,
<a href="http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=116148">pop-up ads</a>,
<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101031030416AAx8878">flash ads</a>,
<a href="http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-wants-torrent-sites-to-adopt-torrent-tweet-100806/">twitter tools</a>, or anything else.
<li>It doesn't hold some features back for a <a href="http://www.vuze.com/compare.php">payware version</a>.
<li>Its source code is <a href="https://github.com/transmission/transmission">available for anyone to review</a>.
<li>We don't track our users, and our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Easy.</h3>
<p>Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. We've set the defaults to <q>Just Work</q> and it only takes a few clicks to configure advanced features like watch directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface. When <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/transmission-bittorrent-client-ubuntu-080130/">Ubuntu chose Transmission</a> as its default BitTorrent client, one of the most-cited reasons was its easy learning curve.</p>

<h3>Lean.</h3>

<p>In separate benchmarks, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fEda8.png">Linux Format</a> and <a href="http://pastehtml.com/view/5tx16jw.html">Lacrocivious</a> both found Transmission to use less CPU than any other GUI client. It even used less CPU than some non-GUI clients.</p>

<p>Transmission also has the lowest memory footprint <a href="http://pastehtml.com/view/5tx16jw.html">of any major BitTorrent client</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?t=4993">Imageshack chose Transmission</a> for its BitTorrent farms because the competition <q><a href="http://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=25006&sid=643539d46bab01ecd02b78b4fbe07602#p25006">requires amounts of memory several times greater than Transmission</a></q>.</p>

<p>Transmission's small footprint is one reason why many home device manufacturers, such as
<a href="http://blog.fon.com/en/archive/technology/new-firmware-for-fonera-2-0g.html">FON</a>,
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Wireless-Router-bittorrent-torrent-p2p,10055.html">Belkin</a>, and
<a href="http://www.networkedmediatank.com/wiki/index.php/BitTorrent">Networked Media Tank</a>
ship with Transmission.  When Belkin and Vuze Inc. partnered to write a <q><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Wireless-Router-bittorrent-torrent-p2p,10055.html">Torrent Genie</a></q> to let people who ran Vuze and owned a Belkin router keep sharing files even when Vuze wasn't running, they decided to use Transmission -- not Vuze's own BitTorrent client -- on the router.</p>

<h3>Native.</h3>
<p>Unlike many cross-platform applications, Transmission integrates seamlessly with your operating system.</p
<p>The <a href="/images/screenshots/Mac-Large.png">Mac OS X interface</a> is written in Objective-C and uses dock badging to keep you informed.</p>

<blockquote>
<span style="font-style: italic"><q>It's fast, it's extremely lightweight, and &mdash; even though it's available for a variety of platforms &mdash; it behaves just as you'd expect a Mac program to.</q></span>
<br />
<a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/134316/2008/08/transmission1gem.html"><i>Macworld, naming Transmission a <q>Mac Gem</q></i></a>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="/images/screenshots/GTK-Large.jpg">GTK+ interface</a> has been carefully written to follow the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/hig-book/">GNOME Human Interface Guidelines</a>. If your desktop supports popup notifications, desktop sounds, and a system tray, the GTK+ interface will make use of them.</a>

<h3>Powerful.</h3>
<p>Transmission has the features you want from a BitTorrent client: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_protocol_encryption">encryption</a>, a web interface, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_exchange">peer exchange</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme">magnet links</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Transport_Protocol">ÂµTP</a>, UPnP and NAT-PMP port forwarding, webseed support, watch directories, tracker editing, global and per-torrent speed limits, and more.</p>
